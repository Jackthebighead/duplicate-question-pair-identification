    "# BERT for QQP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune BERT on quora question pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "From my point of view, there are two ways to use BERT in qqp, one way is using the pretrained BERT to embed sentences, the embedded vectors are the features in the NN model, and the rest steps are easy (feed the features into neural network sturctures and classify question pairs). Actually there are some implementations on that such as `SBERT`(Sentence BERT, or `sentence-transformations`), we can also use packages like `bert as a service` to use the pretrained model easily. Another way is to do fine-tuning the BERT model on downstream tasks, which may achieve a better performance since the pretrained model will be trained on the downstream training dataset. So here we implement the second idea, we did fine-tuning for BERT on qqp problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains two parts:\n",
    "- The first part is **BERT pretrained model**(using `bert-base-uncased` model): to embed input ([id,attention_masks,token_type_id]).\n",
    "- The second part is **a neural network sturcture** consists of {bilstm-pooling-dense-sigmoid} with dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model, these things are done step by step:\n",
    "  - prepare the raw data (load, preprocess...)\n",
    "  - create a data generator and generate training and testing data for the model\n",
    "  - set bert_model.trainable=False, train the model (train the layers in the neural network structure)\n",
    "  - set bert_model.trainable=Ture, train the model again (fine-tuning BERT)\n",
    "  - make predictions on the testing set\n",
    "  - get submissions on qqp problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The model scores **0.27835**. Although not better than our featured Siamese-LSTM model (becasue this model is not mature), there are some improvements will be done in the future :\n",
    "  - add more features (feature_nlp.csv, feature_tm.csv, etc...) from `feature_engineering_train.ipynb` as a supplement\n",
    "  - adjust the neural network structure (layers to perform 'feature extraction')\n",
    "  - hyperparameters and training epoches (we just use 1 epoch training to get the scores due to time and resources limit)\n",
    "  - ...\n",
    "\n",
